      placeholder: "I would like to have a command to give users credits, that would make it easier for me to administrate credits! I would like it to add a specified amount of credits to specified user, without taking credits from the executer. Command should require Manage Guild permission. When successful, it should return something like: Added <amount> credits to <user>!"
